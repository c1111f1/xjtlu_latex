This is an example of a latex template for XJTLU EEE department.

Currently, the template is available. But the user manual hasn't been finished. 

After the user manual is finished, I will publish this template to help students in XJTLU EEE student to write reports in a good format easily.

Before that, I cannot provide any help. You can try by yourself!

Note:
Download latex: http://www.ctex.org/CTeXDownload.

After you install CTex, some help documents are included in the package.

Good Luck!
